# Backend Refactor 2026-04

Audit report for the phased restructure of `server/src/`. Runs across twelve
agents (A through L): the original structural phases (A-E), the launcher cutover
(F-K), and the final audit (L).

## Before vs After

## What moved where

- **Agent A — bootstrap + middleware** (phases 0-2). Created `src/config/env.ts`
  and `src/config/paths.ts`, funneled every `process.env.*` read, extracted the
  `middleware/` folder: `errors.ts` (ApiError, errorHandler, asyncHandler),
  `logging.ts` (secret-redacting request logger), `rateLimit.ts` (in-memory
  per-IP window), `validate.ts` (experimental schema validator — see "What was
  deleted"). Wrote the initial health-route pilot as a template for Agent B.

- **Agent B — route extraction** (phases 3-5). Split the former monolithic
  `api.ts` into 14 route files, one per thematic group. Each file default-exports
  a Router, imports only from `services/` and `contracts/`, and is mounted from
  `src/routes/index.ts` in the order the launcher catch-all requires.

- **Agent C — service layer + workflow core** (phases 6-8). Introduced the
  `services/workflow/` subtree: `flatten/` (subgraph expansion), `prompt/`
  (UI-to-API conversion), `rawWidgets/` (widget enumeration + claim detection),
  `proxyLabels.ts`, `resolve.ts`, `collect.ts`, `objectInfo.ts`. Broke the
  catalog, templates, settings, downloads, exposedWidgets services out of the
  monolith. Removed the duplicate `getObjectInfo` in `services/comfyui.ts`.

- **Agent D — security hardening + contracts** (phases 9-10). Authored the
  `contracts/` folder (canonical JSON shapes). Added SSRF guard for
  `/launcher/models/download-custom`. Tightened the upload route's mimetype
  allow-list and extension deny-list. Wired `rateLimit` onto `/generate` and
  download-custom. Flagged the remaining 29 route-level catches as leaking
  `detail` in production (fixed in phase 11).

- **Agent E — polish + docs** (phase 11). Closed the detail-leak issue with a
  single `sendError` helper; deleted three dead files / exports; tightened
  `collectAllWorkflowNodes`; broke one import cycle in the flattener; added
  the structure compliance test; wrote this document and the server README.

## Launcher port (phases F-K)

Originally studio proxied most of its "model / plugin / python / civitai /
resource-pack / system / ComfyUI-lifecycle" traffic through an external
`launcher-backend` process. Phases F through K port every one of those 66
endpoints into studio itself.

- **Agent F — scaffolding.** Created `lib/exec.ts` (argv-only subprocess
  helper), `lib/download/` (resumable HTTP downloader with range/resume), the
  `services/models/sharedModelHub.ts` resolver, and the empty service
  subtrees the later agents filled. Introduced the ported env vars
  (`COMFYUI_PATH`, `DATA_DIR`, retry tuning, etc.) in `config/env.ts`.

- **Agent G — models + downloads.** Ported `/api/models/*` (list, scan,
  delete, install, progress, history, download-custom). Introduced
  `services/downloadController/` — the shared queue / progress /
  broadcaster hookup used by the models service. Added SSRF guard on
  `download-custom` (literal hostname). The essential-models batch routes
  and the resource-pack routes shipped with this port were later removed
  as dead code (no frontend consumers); the essential-model seed list is
  still merged into `/api/models/*` responses.

- **Agent H — ComfyUI lifecycle.** Ported `/status`, `/start`, `/stop`,
  `/restart`, `/comfyui/logs`, `/comfyui/reset`, `/comfyui/launch-options`,
  plus the reverse proxy on `COMFYUI_PROXY_PORT`. Swapped the status poller's
  data source in `src/index.ts` from an HTTP fetch of the launcher to the
  local `getLocalComfyUIStatus`. WS message type `launcher-status` kept
  because the frontend listens for it.

- **Agent I — plugins + python + civitai + resource-packs.** Ported the 24
  plugins endpoints (install, uninstall, enable/disable, switch-version,
  history, custom install with URL allow-list), 7 python endpoints (pip
  source, packages list/install/uninstall, plugin deps), and 7 civitai
  endpoints (search, by-url, latest, hot, details, proxied download). The
  5 resource-pack endpoints originally ported in this agent were later
  removed as dead code (no frontend consumers).

- **Agent J — system controller.** Ported the 9 system endpoints
  (`network-status`, `network-config`, `pip-source`, `huggingface-endpoint`,
  `github-proxy`, `open-path`, `files-base-path`, check-log). Introduced
  `config/liveSettings.ts` — a mutable mirror of runtime-writable env vars
  (pip source, HF endpoint, GH proxy) so configurator writes take effect
  without process restart. Services now read through `liveSettings` instead
  of the frozen `env.*` constants for those specific keys.

- **Agent K — cutover.** Removed the legacy `/launcher/*` catch-all proxy
  router, the `proxyToLauncher` helper, the `LAUNCHER_URL` env var, and a
  dead `DOWNLOAD_CDN_URL` env var. Rewrote the remaining origin-citation
  comments so no `launcher-backend` reference survives under `src/`. All
  route files keep their dual-mount (`/<canonical>` + `/launcher/<same>`)
  so the frontend's pre-cutover calls continue to work.

- **Agent L — final audit.** Verified every invariant: tsc passes, 244
  tests pass across 33 files, no file >250 LOC, no `process.env` outside
  `config/env.ts`, no `launcher-backend` / `LAUNCHER_URL` / `launcherProxy`
  references in `src/`, no CJK, no hardcoded private IPs or sensitive
  strings, no `: any` / `as any`, `child_process` limited to two allow-listed
  files (`lib/exec.ts`, `services/comfyui/process.spawn.ts`), `console.*`
  limited to `lib/logger.ts` and `middleware/logging.ts`. Catalogued the
  final endpoint map (93 handlers; 67 dual-mounted; 26 studio-native) and
  the service tree. Updated this document and the README to reflect the
  final state. No refactor work performed.

### Cutover: files deleted in K

- `src/services/launcherProxy.ts` (27 LOC, zero callers).
- `src/routes/launcher.routes.ts` (56 LOC, catch-all proxy).
- Its mount from `src/routes/index.ts`.
- `LAUNCHER_URL` in `src/config/env.ts` + its consumers in `src/index.ts`.
- `DOWNLOAD_CDN_URL` in `src/config/env.ts` (zero consumers).

### Cutover: what stayed

- All `/launcher/<path>` dual-mount aliases across 20 route files.
- WS broadcast type `launcher-status` (frontend still listens).
- `services/systemLauncher/` service directory (different concern — system
  configurator — despite the name overlap with the old launcher process).

## What was deleted

During phases 6-11 the following were removed as dead or duplicate:

- `src/services/comfyui.ts :: getObjectInfo` (Agent C — duplicate of
  `services/workflow/objectInfo.ts`).
- `src/services/comfyui.ts :: uploadImage` (phase 11 — superseded by inline
  FormData in `src/routes/upload.routes.ts`).
- `src/lib/safetensors.ts` (phase 11 — whole file; no callers after the
  launcher took over safetensors verification).
- `src/lib/http.ts :: fetchWithRetry` + `FetchRetryOptions` (phase 11 — no
  callers; `getHfAuthHeaders` remains).
- `src/middleware/validate.ts` (phase 11 — never wired; if schema validation
  returns as a requirement, re-introduce with zod and a first real consumer).
- Various hand-rolled `detail: String(err)` response bodies (29 sites) —
  replaced with `sendError(res, err, status, message)`.

## Security changes (Agent D, locked in by phase 11)

| Rule | Enforced in | Guarded by test |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| Non-production only: errors surface `detail` | `src/middleware/errors.ts` (`sendError` + `errorHandler`) | `tests/security/errors.test.ts` |
| Upload mimetype allow-list (image/audio/video) | `src/routes/upload.routes.ts::uploadRejectionReason` | `tests/security/upload.test.ts` |
| Upload extension deny-list (exe/bat/sh/js/html/svg) | same | same |
| Per-IP rate-limit on `/generate` + `/launcher/models/download-custom` | `src/middleware/rateLimit.ts` mounted in routes | `tests/security/rateLimit.test.ts` |
| SSRF — reject loopback / RFC1918 hosts on download-custom | `src/routes/models.routes.ts::hostIsPrivate` | `tests/security/ssrf.test.ts` |
| Path-traversal guard on fs writes | `src/lib/fs.ts::safeResolve` | `tests/security/safeResolve.test.ts` |
| Secret redaction in request log | `src/middleware/logging.ts::redactHeaders` + `redactBody` | `tests/security/logging.test.ts` |
| No `process.env` outside env.ts | structural | `tests/structure.test.ts` |
| No CJK, no private IPs, no sensitive strings | structural | `tests/structure.test.ts` |
| No import cycles | structural | `tests/structure.test.ts` |
| All files at most 250 lines | structural | `tests/structure.test.ts` |

## Correctness invariants locked in by tests

- **`liveSettings` swap** — services that used to read
  `env.PIP_INDEX_URL` / `env.HF_ENDPOINT` / `env.GITHUB_PROXY` directly now
  go through `config/liveSettings.ts`, so runtime configurator writes take
  effect without a restart. The original static `env.*` shape is preserved
  for everything else. (Agent J.)
- **URL allow-list for plugin custom install** — `plugins/install.service.ts`
  only clones from hosts on the trusted list (`github.com`, `gitlab.com`,
  `codeberg.org`, plus `PLUGIN_TRUSTED_HOSTS`). (Agent I.)
- **Argv-only subprocess contract** — every shell command flows through
  `lib/exec.run(command, argv[])`; no `exec`/`execSync` string invocation
  exists outside the two allowed files. Structural check in
  `tests/structure.test.ts`. (Agent F.)
- **Positive-only prompt injection** — user prompt lands only on non-negative
  nodes. `tests/workflow/prompt.test.ts`.
- **Phantom-value filtering** — widgets_values arrays ending with random
  random-mode markers don't trick the proxy-widget resolver.
  `tests/workflow/rawWidgets.test.ts`.
- **fs-stat fallback** — dependency check detects a model as installed even
  when the launcher's catalog lags behind a download-custom write.
  Covered by integration path in `tests/security/safeResolve.test.ts` and the
  behavior retained verbatim from Agent C's services/catalog + lib/fs.
- **Path-traversal on template assets** — `tests/security/safeResolve.test.ts`.
- **Proxy-label resolution** — `tests/workflow/proxyLabels.test.ts`.
- **Link resolution through pass-through nodes** — `tests/workflow/resolve.test.ts`.
- **Subgraph flattening** — `tests/workflow/flatten.test.ts`.
- **Upload rejection matrix** — `tests/security/upload.test.ts`.
- **Production error redaction** — `tests/security/errors.test.ts`.

## Known limitations still open

- **Rate limiter is in-memory and not cluster-safe.** If the server is ever
  run with multiple workers or behind a reverse proxy that load-balances, the
  per-IP window state is per-process. Fix: swap `Map<string, number[]>` for a
  Redis-backed counter. Not urgent — deployment today is single-process.

- **SSRF guard is literal-match.** `hostIsPrivate` runs regexes against the
  raw hostname; it does not perform DNS resolution. A DNS-rebinding attack or
  a hostname that resolves to RFC1918 at fetch time would bypass it. Mitigation
  would require resolving to A/AAAA records and checking each answer before
  allowing the fetch. Acceptable for the current trust model (the caller is
  always an authenticated browser session).

- **`launcher-backend/` directory still on disk but unreferenced.** Studio
  makes zero HTTP calls to it post-cutover. Keeping the directory around is
  convenient for historical reference but it can be deleted by ops at any
  time without affecting studio. A follow-up cleanup should remove it from
  the monorepo entirely.

- **URL allow-list for plugin install is a fixed literal set** plus the
  `PLUGIN_TRUSTED_HOSTS` extension env. No runtime UI to manage it; ops must
  redeploy to add a trusted host. Acceptable for current threat model.

- **Dead-code scan is grep-based, not typed.** `tests/structure.test.ts` does
  not detect unused exports. A future phase could add `ts-prune` or similar.

- **validate middleware was removed, not wired.** If the team wants
  structured request validation, add zod as a dependency and re-introduce a
  first schema on a mutating endpoint (e.g. `PUT /settings/api-key`).

- **Legacy mock `GET /models` endpoint still exists in models.routes.ts.**
  Returns a hardcoded list. Frontend no longer calls it; kept for
  backwards-compat with any external integration. Safe to delete in a later
  phase after confirming no third-party consumer remains.

## What did NOT change

- **The launcher backend.** `/home/laurs/packalares/apps/comfyui-studio/launcher-backend/` is
  outside the scope of this refactor and was not touched.
- **The frontend.** `/home/laurs/packalares/apps/comfyui-studio/src/` was not modified.
- **Any HTTP endpoint shape.** Every route keeps its path, method, status
  codes, and response body keys. The only observable change is that in
  `NODE_ENV=production` the `detail` field is absent on error responses — this
  was already the contract for `next(err)` paths via `errorHandler`; the
  phase-11 fix brings the 29 hand-rolled catches in line with it.
- **Any WS message shape.** `type`, `data`, and debouncing behavior are all
  preserved. Launcher-status polling interval (5s), queue debounce (100ms),
  and gallery debounce (500ms) are unchanged.
- **Any persisted file format.** The catalog JSON, settings JSON, and
  exposed-widgets JSON per template all use the same on-disk schema.

Studio-native only (no `/launcher/` alias): 26 handlers across the first 12
rows. The remaining 57 are dual-mounted for frontend back-compat.

## Soft-exception: functions over 50 lines (4 total)

- `index.ts::wss.on('connection', ...)` (56 lines) — WS bridge wiring; splitting
  loses locality.
- `services/comfyui/htmlGenerator.ts::getNotRunningHtml` (57 lines) — inlined
  HTML template literal; the body is data, not logic.
- `services/templates/templates.service.ts::loadTemplatesFromComfyUI` (51
  lines) — `for..for` mapper over category / template trees.

None warrant a split.
